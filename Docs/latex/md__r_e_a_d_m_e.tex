\subsection*{Description\-:}

Models the technical and financial details of a photovoltaic farm. The user specifies the parameters of the site which then calculates the expected output energy at the grid entry point (G\-E\-P).

A site and grid entry point can be selected using G\-P\-S coordinates which assist in calculating the insolation from the sun using \href{https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar}{\tt Py\-Solar}. System components such as panels, D\-C and A\-C cables, inverter, transformer and transmission lines can be specified using the graphical user interface, which will then run the model simulation.

The outputs from the simulation can be listed and plotted for the user to determine if the parameters produce a viable solar farm.

\subsection*{How to run}

In it's current state, the calculator should run on any operating system that supports python and the dependant packges.

\subsubsection*{Install Dependancies}

The packages that this project depends on are
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://www.numpy.org/}{\tt Num\-Py}
\item \href{http://matplotlib.org/}{\tt Mat\-Plot\-Lib}
\item \href{http://pysolar.org/}{\tt Py\-Solar}
\item \href{http://www.wxpython.org/}{\tt wx\-Python 2.\-9}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Special thanks goes out to the above projects for providing such great tools!

\subsubsection*{Open\-Exchange\-Rates.\-org A\-P\-I Key}

An A\-P\-I key is required from \href{https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free}{\tt Open\-Exchange\-Rates.\-org}. The free A\-P\-I key will suffice for this project as there is a limit to how often the software will hit the A\-P\-I for new data. When you have gotten an A\-P\-I key place it at the top of Assets.\-py to ensure the exchange rates are retreieved.
