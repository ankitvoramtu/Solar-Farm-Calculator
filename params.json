{"name":"Solar Farm Calculator","tagline":"Calculator to model a generic solar photovoltaic farm","body":"# [Avaliable for download here!](https://sourceforge.net/projects/solar-farm-calculator/)\r\n\r\n## Description: \r\nModels the technical and financial details of a photovoltaic farm. The user\r\nspecifies the parameters of the site which then calculates the expected output\r\nenergy at the grid entry point (GEP).\r\n\r\nA site and grid entry point can be selected using GPS coordinates which assist\r\nin calculating the insolation from the sun using [PySolar](https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar).\r\nSystem components such as panels, DC and AC cables, inverter, transformer and\r\ntransmission lines can be specified using the graphical user interface, which\r\nwill then run the model simulation.\r\n\r\nThe outputs from the simulation can be listed and plotted for the user to\r\ndetermine if the parameters produce a viable solar farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors:\r\n[Ashok Fernandez](https://github.com/ashokfernandez/),\r\n[Jarrad Raumati](https://github.com/jarradraumati/),\r\nDarren O'Neill\r\n\r\n## How to run:\r\nIn it's current state, the calculator should run on any operating system that supports python and the dependant packges.\r\nOnce dependant packages are installed and an OpenExchangeRates API key is inserted into the relevant place (see below) the \r\nprogram can be run by running main.py either in an IDE or by opening a shell in the main folder and typing\r\n\r\n    python main.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Overview\r\nIf you are interested in developing this project further a comprehensive overview of the code is avaliable on the [wiki page for this project](https://github.com/ashokfernandez/Solar-Farm-Calculator/wiki/Code-Overview). \r\n\r\n### Install Dependancies\r\nThe packages that this project depends on are\r\n * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\r\n * [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/)\r\n * [PySolar](http://pysolar.org/)\r\n * [wxPython 2.9](http://www.wxpython.org/)\r\n\r\nFurthermore the GUI was designed using [wxFormBuilder](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/), the design file for this can \r\nbe found in the GUIDesign folder\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks goes out to the above projects for providing such great tools!\r\n\r\n### OpenExchangeRates.org API Key:\r\nAn API key is required from [OpenExchangeRates.org](https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free). The free API key will suffice\r\nfor this project as there is a limit to how often the software will hit the API for new data. When you have gotten an API key \r\nplace it at the top of Assets.py to ensure the exchange rates are retreieved.\r\n\r\n## Build the Documentation:\r\nThe code has been heavily documented, this can be compiled into a PDF using [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) and [latex](http://www.latex-project.org/) or as a web reference manual using [Epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/). \r\n\r\n### HTML Documentation\r\nTo build the HTML documentation (recommeded over the PDF - it's a lot easier to follow) you first need to install Epydoc. If you have pip installed you can do this opening a terminal and typing\r\n   \r\n    sudo pip install epydoc\r\n\r\nOtherwise follow the installation instructions on the [Epydoc website](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-install.html).\r\n\r\nOnce Epydoc is installed, open a terminal in the /Docs/ folder and type\r\n\r\n    epydoc --config epydocfile\r\n\r\nThis will generate HTML documentation which can be accessed by opening /Docs/html/index.html\r\n\r\n### PDF Documentation\r\nTo build the PDF documentation install doxygen and latex then open a shell in the Docs directory and type\r\n\r\n    doxygen\r\n    cd latex/\r\n    make\r\n\r\nA documentation file 'refman.pdf' will be avaliable in the latex folder which outlines in detail the different classes in the code and how they function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future Work:\r\nThe addition of extra settings in the settings pane would be nice - perhaps include an option to tweak the simulation timestep and a space to enter an OpenExchangeRates API key.","google":"UA-34034047-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
